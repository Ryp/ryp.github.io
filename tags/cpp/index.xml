This language in interesting in itself and I recommend you check it out if you didn&amp;rsquo;t before, but for today we&amp;rsquo;re staying in magical C++ land.
Got the idea from this blog post that I could use the Zig compiler as replacement for Clang, GCC and MSVC in my engine and stop having to use Visual Studio on windows.
Sounds enticing, right?</description></item><item><title>CHIP-8 Emulator</title><link>https://ryp.github.io/2019/chip-8-emulator/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 May 2019 12:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://ryp.github.io/2019/chip-8-emulator/</guid><description>Thought it was a fun idea to implement a very basic emulator so I did just that! My CHIP-8 emu can run most vanilla ROMs without problems. It&amp;rsquo;s a simple 8bits computer with a rather reduced instruction set, so it wasn&amp;rsquo;t too much pain to get things going.
I used the publicly available ROMs for testing as well as a bunch of custom unit tests. I have to say it was a fun little side projet, especially since I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to write any of the games for it, just load that ROM and here we go!</description></item><item><title>Weekend Raytracer Project</title><link>https://ryp.github.io/2018/weekend-raytracer-project/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Aug 2018 19:59:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://ryp.github.io/2018/weekend-raytracer-project/</guid><description>Raytracers are one of those cool programs that you can write in a few hours and already have something fun to play with. I never got to write one at school so I figured I would spend a day or two and get one going!
Because many other sources recommend it, I downloaded Peter Shirley&amp;rsquo;s book Ray tracing in one weekend and gave it a go. Even though I was familiar with the concepts, it was a good exercise and also surprisingly fun!</description></item></channel></rss>
