So if not Rust, what kind shiny new thing is around on the block?
Zig Zig has been around some time now, the community is active but didn&amp;rsquo;t grow into large scale yet. It seems to aim at low-level programmers, as a safer alternative to C with a lean feature set and better performance.</description></item><item><title>CHIP-8 Emulator: Rust port</title><link>https://ryp.github.io/2019/chip-8-emulator-rust-port/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jul 2019 12:00:00 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://ryp.github.io/2019/chip-8-emulator-rust-port/</guid><description>tl;dr: I ported my CHIP-8 emulator to Rust.
Amongst game dev circles, Rust is certainly getting a lot of attention recently, especially since Ready At Dawn announced they would be switching entirely to Rust for newly-written code. This is certainly a big thing, coming from such an experienced studio (we gamedevs are notoriously picky when adopting new libraries/languages), and proves that Rust is taken seriously for replacing C++.
Personally, I tend to dislike C++ and its ecosystem, and couldn&amp;rsquo;t be happier that new languages try address the need for a superior paradigm.</description></item><item><title>CHIP-8 Emulator</title><link>https://ryp.github.io/2019/chip-8-emulator/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 May 2019 12:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://ryp.github.io/2019/chip-8-emulator/</guid><description>Thought it was a fun idea to implement a very basic emulator so I did just that! My CHIP-8 emu can run most vanilla ROMs without problems. It&amp;rsquo;s a simple 8bits computer with a rather reduced instruction set, so it wasn&amp;rsquo;t too much pain to get things going.
I used the publicly available ROMs for testing as well as a bunch of custom unit tests. I have to say it was a fun little side projet, especially since I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to write any of the games for it, just load that ROM and here we go!</description></item></channel></rss>
