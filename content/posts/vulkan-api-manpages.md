I still find good old manpages really useful for coding, their long lifetime made them reliable and well integrated into a lot of tools (vim in my case). What's more satisfying than accessing the exact doc you're looking for in a couple of keystrokes? It's hard to go back to browsing HTML docs after that...

Imagine the sadness when Khronos stopped supporting the vulkan API manpages!
Long story short, I tried to add the support upstream (see [PR #839](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Docs/pull/839)), ended up keeping an unofficial fork and released something usable there (formatting is still weird sometimes).

As usual, the source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Ryp/Vulkan-Docs).
There's also a [vulkan-man-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/vulkan-man-git/) package on AUR if you're using Arch Linux.
