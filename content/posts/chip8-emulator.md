Thought it was a fun idea to implement a very basic emulator so I did just that!
My [CHIP-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) emu can run most vanilla ROMs without problems.
It's a simple 8bits computer with a rather reduced instruction set, so it wasn't too much pain to get
things going.

I used the publicly available ROMs for testing as well as a bunch of custom unit tests.
I have to say it was a fun little side projet, especially since I didn't have to write any of the games for it,
just load that ROM and here we go!

As usual, the source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Ryp/chip8-emu).

If you want to join the fun and make your own, here's a rather complete [documentation](http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM#Dxyn) to get you going!

Here are a bunch of screenshots:
