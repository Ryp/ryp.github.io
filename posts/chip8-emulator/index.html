<div class=post-content><p>Thought it was a fun idea to implement a very basic emulator so I did just that!
My <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8>CHIP-8</a> emu can run most vanilla ROMs without problems.
It&rsquo;s a simple 8bits computer with a rather reduced instruction set, so it wasn&rsquo;t too much pain to get
things going.</p>
<p>I used the publicly available ROMs for testing as well as a bunch of custom unit tests.
I have to say it was a fun little side projet, especially since I didn&rsquo;t have to write any of the games for it,
just load that ROM and here we go!</p>
<p>As usual, the source code is available on <a href=https://github.com/Ryp/chip8-emu>GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to join the fun and make your own, here&rsquo;s a rather complete <a href=http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM#Dxyn>documentation</a> to get you going!</p>
<p>Here are a bunch of screenshots:
