<p>Here&rsquo;s a few pain points I noticed coming back to Zig for the second time:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pointers:</strong> Zig has several pointer types, and it can be confusing sometimes when choosing. You&rsquo;ll get back to the docs a few times before getting this right.</li>
<li><strong>Initialization rules:</strong> Coming from C++, Zig has quite a different philosophy around variable initialization and the syntax for it. Don&rsquo;t expect to write <code>var = {}</code> to get a zero-initialized variable!</li>
<li>If you want something mutable, get a pointer on it! I bumped my head against this a few times, because I expected things like <code>var my_var = array[x]</code> to hold a reference by default. Nope. Get a pointer instead! What&rsquo;s weird here is that the syntax after initialization can stay the same for both variants, so be careful!</li>
