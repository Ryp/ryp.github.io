<p>Because many other sources recommend it, I downloaded Peter Shirley&rsquo;s book <a href=https://in1weekend.blogspot.com/2016/01/ray-tracing-in-one-weekend.html>Ray tracing in one weekend</a> and gave it a go.
Even though I was familiar with the concepts, it was a good exercise and also surprisingly fun!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d really recommend this book since it gives you enough knowledge to get things going without drowning you into too much implementation details. You&rsquo;ll get to practice basic matrix transformations, ray intersection maths, random distributions, surface shading amongst other topics.</p>
<p>As a reference I&rsquo;ve put the full source code of my implementation on <a href=https://github.com/Ryp/raytracer>GitHub</a>.</p>
