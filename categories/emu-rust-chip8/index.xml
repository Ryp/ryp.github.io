Amongst game dev circles, Rust is certainly getting a lot of attention recently, especially since Ready At Dawn announced they would be switching entirely to Rust for newly-written code. This is certainly a big thing, coming from such an experienced studio (we gamedevs are notoriously picky when adopting new libraries/languages), and proves that Rust is taken seriously for replacing C++.
Personally, I tend to dislike C++ and its ecosystem, and couldn&amp;rsquo;t be happier that new languages try address the need for a superior paradigm.</description></item></channel></rss>
