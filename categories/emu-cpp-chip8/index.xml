My CHIP-8 emu can run most vanilla ROMs without problems. It&amp;rsquo;s a simple 8bits computer with a rather reduced instruction set, so it wasn&amp;rsquo;t too much pain to get things going.
I used the publicly available ROMs for testing as well as a bunch of custom unit tests. I have to say it was a fun little side projet, especially since I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to write any of the games for it, just load that ROM and here we go!</description></item></channel></rss>
